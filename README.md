Use XQuartz to execute and display the program.
Commands:
left: move the block to its left by 1 unit
right: move the block to its left by 1 unit
up: move the block to its left by 1 unit
down: move the block to its left by 1 unit
drop: move the block as down as possible and change to the next block
clockwise: move the block 90 degrees in clockwise direction
anticlockwise: move the block 90 degrees in anti-clockwise direction

Any command above can be added with a numerical value, eg. 5left, meaning move to left by 5 units.
Unambiguous short-formed commands can be recogized too, such as dr being equivalent to drop.
